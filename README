DESCRIPTION

This contribution contains a formalisation of algebraic operations on
coinductive streams representing real numbers in the interval [-1,1].
This includes:

 * A ternary representation for real numbers in [-1,1] using the type
   [Reals] (see digits.v).
 * Proof that this is a representation for real numbers using the real
   numbers of the standard library (see Cauchy_stream.v).
 * Implementation of the homographic algorithm using a general
   corecursion technique explained in [1] (see homographic.v).
 * Implementation of the quadratic algorithm using a general
   corecursion technique explained in [1] (see quadratic.v).
 * A coinductive proof of correctness of the algorithms as explained
   in [2] (see hcorrectness.v and qcorrectness.v).
 * A metric proof of the correctness of the algorithms (see
   productivity_M.v and productivity_T.v). These are the formalisation
   of the proofs in Chapter 5 of [3].

USAGE

 The files should be compiled using Coq version 8.1 or higher. They
 also need the rational numbers of QArith-Stern-Brocot package which
 could be downloaded from:

  http://coq.inria.fr/contribs/QArith-Stern-Brocot.tar.gz
 
 or from svn archive in the subdirectory Nijmegen/QArith.

 First compile the QArith_Stern_Brocot package and make sure it is in
 the load path for your coqc command.

 Then you can compile this contribution using the provided
 Makefile. In order to compile the files do the following:

$ touch .depend
$ make depend
$ make
